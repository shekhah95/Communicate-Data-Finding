## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found that the borrower APR is negatively correlated with original loan amount. At different size of the loan amount, the APR has a large range, but the range of APR decrease with the increase of loan amount , I found the top occupations counts are  ‘Professional’, ‘computer programmer’,’ "Executives" and ‘Teacher’ and , The largest amount of borrowers are employed and full-time.

The loan original amount has a positive correlation with the stated monthly income and Term (no. of months ), and No. of Investors, it makes sense since the more The loan original amount, more months to pay, and the borrower has a higher monthly income and of course investors on this loans.
In gerenral at each ListingCategory by increasing the LoanOriginalAmount, the APR decreases.
